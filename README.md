Done:
1.Make an API call to http://staging-beamafilm.com/api/dev/mock-films to get a list
of film images in JSON format. Note the result will be 20 randomized films with
each contained titles and images.
2.The result of the API should be rendered inside a carousel, (example in
https://beamafilm.com/catalogue). You can slide it left or right.
5. You are allowed to use any library/package as you see fit.
3.There is a button called “Reload”, if clicked you should call the API again and
update/replace the carousel with a new set of films.

To do:
4. A good design (Not a high priority)
